# Volume

This project provides a lib-data-broker display compatible volume control more in line with how human ears work.

Currently tested with

* ChocolateBar

In most games, volume sliders have a linear output power scale, and WoW is among those. But human hearing is not linear, which makes finding the right volume level harder than it has to be. This addon is meant to help.

## Usage

Use the mouse-wheel on the broker display to change the master volume directly. Click to open the popup controls.
